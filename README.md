# Design Template & Component Library

This repository serves as my **design template and reusable component library**.

It contains a collection of **UI components, layout patterns, and design foundations** that I use as a starting point for projects. The goal is to keep styles **consistent, scalable, and easy to maintain** across different applications.

---

## Purpose

- Act as a **base design system** for future projects
- Store **reusable UI components** (buttons, dialogs, forms, etc.)
- Experiment with and refine styling approaches

This repository is a work in progress.
